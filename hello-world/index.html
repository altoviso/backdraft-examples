    <h2>Backdraft Hello World Example Application</h2>
    <p>This application defines a "HelloWorld" Backdraft Component. The component prints "Hello, World" in several
        languages as given by the language property of the component and a set of translations. The main program creates
        and renders an instance of HelloWorld in the black block below, and then changes the language property every
        second, causing the component to lookup and reflect the translation to the DOM. The className property of the
        DIV node is also changed to the language and the associated CSS colors the translation according to the
        class.</p>
    <p>This page loads the source version (not aggregated or minimized) of Backdraft and, as you can see, the page is
        very minimal. Open the debugger and explore!</p>
    <p>This program is discussed in the tutorial section
        <a href="http://backdraftjs.org/tutorial.html#bd-tutorial.helloWorld">Hello,
            World</a>. The code for the program is in the github repo
        <a href="https://github.com/altoviso/backdraft-examples/tree/master/hello-world">altoviso/backdraft-examples</a>.
