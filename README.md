# Backdraft Tutorial and Example Code

This repository contains all code used in various Backdraft tutorials and examples.


Backdraft is extensively documented at [backdraftjs.org](http://backdraftjs.org).

## Install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/altoviso/backdraft-examples.git
$ cd backdraft-examples
$ npm install
```

A small [Express server](https://github.com/altoviso/backdraft-examples/blob/master/httpServer.js) is included to serve the project root so the examples can be run. To start this server:

```
$ npm run server
```


## What's Included

### hello-world.html
Code used for the single file quick start demo shown in [Installation](http://backdraftjs.org/install.html).

### hello-world.amd.html
Code used for the single file quick start AMD demo shown in [Installation](http://backdraftjs.org/install.html).

### hello-world
Code used for Section [Hello, World](http://backdraftjs.org/tutorial.html#bd-tutorial.helloWorld)  of the Tutorial.

### js-framework-benchmark
A Backdraft implementation of the [js-framework-benchmark](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark) exercise.

### polygraph
A Backdraft implementation of the Vue Polygraph demo. A good example of reflecting [watchable data](http://backdraftjs.org/tutorial.html#bd-tutorial.watchableData), [SVG elements](http://backdraftjs.org/docs.html#bd-core.functions.svg), and building components with variable, homogeneous [children components](http://backdraftjs.org/tutorial.html#bd-tutorial.children).

### schedule
Demonstrates a sortable grid with sort-controlling widgets in the header. Both the grid and the widgets are built from scratch with Backdraft with no external dependencies. This is a really nice demo of how performant Backdraft code can be and how easy it is to build complex user interface widgets.

### Thinking in Backdraft.
Demonstrates the [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) example as expressed with Backdraft. It is interesting that most React's discussion applies equally to Backdraft yet the underlying design of React and Backdraft are quite different.

### todomvc
A Backdraft implementation of the [todomvc](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) exercise.
