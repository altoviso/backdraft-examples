## What's Included

### hello-world-dynamic
Code used for Section [Components](http://backdraftjs.org/tutorial/3-components.html)  of the Tutorial.

### hello-world-static

### js-framework-benchmark
A Backdraft implementation of the [js-framework-benchmark](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark) exercise.

### schedule
Demonstrates a sortable grid with sort-controlling widgets in the header. Both the grid and the widgets are built from scratch with Backdraft with no external dependencies. This is a really nice demo of how performant Backdraft code can be and how easy it is to build complex user interface widgets.

### state-button
Code used for Secttion [Events](http://backdraftjs.org/tutorial/4-events.html) of the Tutorial.

### Thinking in Backdraft.
Demonstrates the [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) example as expressed with Backdraft. It is interesting that most React's discussion applies equally to Backdraft yet the underlying design of React and Backdraft are quite different.

### todomvc
A Backdraft implementation of the [todomvc](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) exercise.
